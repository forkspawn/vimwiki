= Memory Command =

* This command allows you to describe the different memories present in the target and their 
	start address and size information.
* The linker uses information mentioned in this command to assign address to merged sections.
* The information is given under this command also helps the linker to calculate total code and 
	data memory consumed so far and throw an error message if data, code, heap or stack areas 
	cannot fit into the available memory size.
* By using memory command, you can fine-tune various memories available in your target and allow 
	different sections to occupy different memory areas.
* Typically one linker script has one memory command.
