= ENTRY Command =

* This Command is used to set the _*"Entry point address"*_ information in the header of the 
	final elf file generated.
* In our case, "Reset_Handler" is the entry point into the application. The first piece of code 
	that executes right after the processor reset. Look at the [[file:/home/basith/Coding/microcontroller_programming/stm32/stm32f407vgt6/src/stm32_startup.c|Startup File]].
* The debugger uses this information to locate the first function to execute.
* Not a mandatory command to use, but required when you debug the elf file using the 
	debugger (GDB).
* Syntax: 
    Entry(_symbol_name_)
    Entry(Reset_Handler)
