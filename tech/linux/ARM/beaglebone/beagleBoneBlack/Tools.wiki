This links to the cross compiler(This works on ubuntu)
[[http://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest-7/arm-linux-gnueabihf/|Cross Compiler - Ubuntu Host OS]]

Compiler Name:
gcc-linaro-7.5.0-2019.12-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz

= For Arch OS =

Arch OS also needs tools similar to ubuntu but their name may vary slightly

== Tool Chain ==

These are cross compiler from yay(arch repositories). I didn't test them.
1. arm-linux-gnueabihf-binutils
2. arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc 
 
But I downloaded the cross compiler from here this [[http://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest-7/arm-linux-gnueabihf/|link]]

Add the binary file (compiler) to $PATH variable(in .zshrc). Now it can used from any terminal.

If you are using bash then put it in .bashrc file.

I needed these tools: 

* uboot-tools lzop

When I was compiling it gave an error saying lzop not found and mkimage not found, so I 
installed them.
