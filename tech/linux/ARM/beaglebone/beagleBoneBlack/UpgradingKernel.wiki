= Why compile a kernel =

= Download Kernel =
Download the kernel from beaglebone black github repo. clone it into a folder.

= Kernel Compilation =
Follow the steps given by the vendor to compile the kernel image.

_*Step1:*_ Remove all temporary folder object files, images generated during the 
previous build. This step also deletes the .config file if created previously. *make ARCH=arm distclean*
_*Step2:*_ Create a .config file by using default config file given by the vendor.

*make ARCH=arm bb.org_defconfig*

_*Step3:*_ This is optional. Run this command only if you want to change some kernel
settings before compilation.

*make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- menuconfig*

_*Step4:*_ Kernel source code compilation. This stage creates a kernel image 
"uImage" and also all device tree source files will be compiled, and dtbs will
be generated.

*make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- uImage dtbs LOADADDR=0x80008000 -j4*

I got an error because I was lacking tools: lzop and uboot-tools. After 
installing it, It generated uImage successfully.

_*Step5:*_ This steps will generate in-tree loadable(M) kernel modules(.ko)

*make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- modules -j4*

_*Step6:*_ This step installs all the generated .ko files in the dafault path
of the computer(/lib/modules/<kernel_ver>)

*sudo make ARCH=arm modules_install*

= Updating BBB kernel =
Rename the old uImage and copy the compiled uImage to boot directory of the
sd card(if you are using sd card to boot). 

Copy the installed modules from local machine /lib/modules/kernel_ver to 
/lib/modules/kernel_ver of the sd card. Then run the command *sync*. Put the sd
card in and reset the board.

If everything works then great but it wasn't working for me. I'm using 
beaglebone black rev C board and instructor is using beaglebone black rev A 
board. It isn't booting. Here are the pictures.

I tried various methods but wasn't successful. I will come back to it later.
