Why static is used in above function?
	Static keyword make the function/variable private. When we dont want this
	function services to be accessed by other functions we use static keyword.
	This fucntion is used for only this module alone. So we use static keyword
	here we are limiting its services to this module only and other module 
	cannot access this function features.
