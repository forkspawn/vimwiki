Out of tree means outside of the linux kernel source tree.

When you write a module separated(which is not approved and may be buggy), build
and link it against the running kernel, then its called as out of the tree
module.

When you load an out of tree kernel module, kernel throws a warning message
saying it got tainted.

= Out of tree = 
Modules are built using "kbuild" which is the build system used by the linux kernel

Modules must use "kbuild" to stay compatible with changes in the build 
infrastructure and to pick up the right flags to GCC.

To build external modules, you must have a prebuilt kenel source available that
contains the configuration and header files used in the build.

This ensures that as the developer changes the kernel configuration, his custom
driver is automatically rebuilt with the correct kernel configuration.
