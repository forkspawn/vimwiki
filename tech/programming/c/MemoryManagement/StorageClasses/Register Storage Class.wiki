* This applicable only on local variables.
* System bus is combination of data bus, control bus, address bus.
* When we use register keyword the variable's memory is allocated in freely available general purpose cpu registers
  for fast access.
* If the cpu registers are not freely available the memory is allocated in stack frame of corresponding function only.
* Compiler will not allow to access the address of a variable with a register keyword.

* Even we cannot read input dynamically for register variables(scanf function)
