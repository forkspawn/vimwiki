= Registers =

* Registers are part of cpu. When data is stored in register data can be accessed at high speed. Since registers 
  are temporary storage for cpu. They have less capacity.

* When to use register storage?
	When the data needed to be accessed at a very high speed then use it. Modern compiler will hint the loader 
	to put the variable with register keyword in CPU registers.

	  How many times does the variable 'i' being accessed. (17 times memory being accessed if i = 10.)

* Why can't the modifiers like auto, static, extern be part of function parameter declaration?
  For example: void fun(static int x, extern int y, auto int z)
	- Its becautse those variables are stored in cpu registers. If we write fun(register int x) then it wont raise 
	  any error.
