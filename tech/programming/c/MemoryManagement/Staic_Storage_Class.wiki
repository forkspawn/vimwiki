= Static Storage Class =

* Static variable is initialized only one time that value will store until the end of the program.
* Difference of the scope static and non-static(automatic)

* Life of staic variable is entire program, data sement data is stored in lower memory area, while stack segment 
  data is stored in upper memory area. When you see the address of stack and data segment then their addresses 
  will be higher and lower respectively.

* Properties of static storage class
	- *Lifetime:*
		* From memory allocation time to till the end of the program.

	- *Scope:*
		* Function scope or block scope if local variables. For global variables scope is entire program. 

	- *Default Value:*
		* Zero. 

	- *Storage Location:*
		* Storage location is data area, if initialized to a non zero value then its in initialized data area 
		  else it is in bss segment. If the value is initialized to zero then the variable will be in bss segment.
