= Realloc =

Syntax: void * realloc(void * ptr, size_t newsize);

The first argument ptr is a pointer to the memory previously allocated by the malloc or calloc functions. The 
second argument 'newsize' is the size in bytes, of a new memory region to be allocated by realloc. This value can 
be larger or smaller than the previously allocated memory. The realloc function will adjusts old memory region if 
newsize is smaller than the size of old memory. If the newsize is larger than the existing memory size, It increases 
the size by compying the contents of old memory region to new memory region. The function then deallocates the old 
memory region. realloc is helpful in managing a dynamic array whose size change during execution time.
