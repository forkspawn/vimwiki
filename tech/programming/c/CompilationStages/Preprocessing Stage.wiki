= Preprocessing Stage =
	In this stage pre processor comes into picture. The preprocessor accepts 
	.c file and it will generate .i file as the output. This output file is 
	called as preprocessed output. This preprocessed output is c code only.
	
	In this stage the statements which are starting with preprocessor directive
	are processed. The statements which starts with preprocessor directive are:
	1. Macro Definitions
	2. Inclusion of header files
	3. Conditional compilation statements
	
	The macro definitions are removed and are replaced with it's value at
	appropriate locations. The contents of header files are placed in place of 
	header files. The conditional compilation statements are removed by some
	part of the code. Even comments are removed in this stage.
	
	How to stop the compilation after first stage
	
	{{{
	
		gcc -E <program file> > ***.i
	
	}}}
	
	To see this preprocessed output we can use normal textual editors. When we
	have preprocessed output we can generate executable file by using 
	
	{{{
	
		gcc ***.i // generate a.out file
	
	}}}
