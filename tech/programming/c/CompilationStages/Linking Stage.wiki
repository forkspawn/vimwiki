= Linking Stage =

1. In this stage linker will come into picture and it combines objfile along 
   with additional objfile which are commonly added for every program or 
   application.
2. The default executable file name is a.out.
3. When you link a library during compilation time by using -l flag and if its 
   a static library the library function involved called in your program those
   function definitions are added in text segment and if it's a dynamic library
   or shared library only particular path is set.
4. In this stage instruction addresses are decided.
5. When we use the command gcc <c program filename> it generates only a.out. 
   Intermediate files like .s, .i, .o are not generated.
6. We cannot see the content of executable file by using textual editor.
7. We have to use objdump and readelf tools to see contents of executable file. 
   {{{
   		objdump -s a.out
		objdump -s ***.o
   }}}
   
   {{{
		gcc --help 
   }}}
   The above command displays flags that can be used with gcc tool.
8. Naming decoration is done only for static local variables and not for 
   global variables in second stage of compilation. 
9. To view memory section/segment sizes use: 
   {{{
   		size ***.o 
   }}}
