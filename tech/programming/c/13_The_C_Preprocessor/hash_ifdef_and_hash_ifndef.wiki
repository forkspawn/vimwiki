= #ifdef and #ifndef = 
Another method of conditional compilation uses the directives #ifdef and #ifndef, which mean "if defined" and 
"if not defined" respectively.

The general form of #ifdef is 

#ifdef macro-name
statement sequence  
#endif

If macro-name has been previously defined in a #define statement, the block of code will be compiled. 

The general form of #ifndef is 

#ifndef macro-name
statement sequence  
#endif

The macro-name is currently undefined by a #define statement, the block of code is compiled.
