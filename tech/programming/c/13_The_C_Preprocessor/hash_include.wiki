= #include =
The #include preprocessor directive causes a copy of a specified file to be included in place of the directive. 
The two forms of the #include directive are: 

#include <filename>
#include "filename" 

The difference between these is the location the preprocessor searches for the file to be included. If the file 
name is enclosed in quotes, the preprocessor seaches in the same directory as the file being compiled for the 
file to be included. This method is normally used to include programmer-defined header files. If the file name 
is enclosed in angle brackets they are - used for standard library header files - the seach is performed in an 
implementation-dependent manner, normally through predesignated directories.
