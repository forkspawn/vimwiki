= #error =
The #error directive forces the compiler to stop compilation. It is used primarily for debugging. The general 
form of the #error directive is 

#error   error-message 

The error-message is not between double quotes. When the #error directive is encountered, the error message is 
displayed, possibly along with other information defined by the compiler. 
For example, 

#ifndef LINUX 

#error This software requires the LINUX OS. 

#endif
