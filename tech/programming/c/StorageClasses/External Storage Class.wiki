* 
* Extern keyword is applicable on global variables and functions.
* Variables which is declared outside the function is called global variables.
* Global variables can be accessed below all the functions till wnd of file from where they are declared or defined.
* To access the global variables in main function we have to use extern keyword or declare that variable with extern keyword.

extern int x
* When you declare a variable with extern keyword this is to inform the compiler that variables memory is allocated 
somewhere, simply access that variable.
* We should not define a global variable locally(inside function) along with extern keyword.
* First time for a global variable we can apply extern keyword, it won't give error but warnings.
* A global variable which is difined/declared in one file cannot be access in another file directly.

For above two files when we do gcc 1.c 2.c we will get compilation error. Instead we need to do the following.

{{vfile:/home/basith/Coding/CProgramming/vivenEmbeddedAcademy/externKeyword5.c}}

In above the scope of x variable is increased till end of function. This variable 'x' cannot be accessed in below
the increment function. Because extern int x; is declared locally to increment function. If we want variable 'x' to 
be available till end of file then we have to declare extern int x; above all functions.

For local variables
Lifetime:
	Program loading time till program terminates.
Scope:
	File scope(global variables)
Default Values:
	Zeros
Storage Location
	.bss or data segment
	
For global variables
Lifetime:
	Program loading time to till program terminates.
Scope:
	We can increase the scope from file to program.
Initial Values:
	Uninitialized global variables conatins zeros. Initiallized global variables contain initiallized values.
Storage Location:
	.data or .bss segment.
