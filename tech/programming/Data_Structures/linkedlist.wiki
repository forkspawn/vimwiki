== Double Linked List ==
* Missed some points
* In doubly linked list it has minimum three fields. 
	* previous field
	* information field
	* next field
* As usually the new node address has to place in the next field of the before node and the previous node of the 
  new node contains the address of the before node. It makes backward to forward to forward direction. The last node 
  of the next field and the previous field of the first node defined by NULL.
