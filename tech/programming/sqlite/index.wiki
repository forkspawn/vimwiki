= Functions =
* Remember to link sqlite3 with the main program 
	* Example: gcc main.c -lsqlite3 (here -l means link)

* sqlite3_libversion()
	* This is used to print the sqlite version on terminal screen. 
	* printf("%s\n", sqlite3_libversion());
* sqlite3 <ptr db>; 
	* It provides [[handle]] to a database.
* sqlite3_stmt <ptr variable>;
	* sqlite3_stmt structure represents a single SQL statement.
* sqlite3_open()
	* This function opens a new database connection. Its parameters 
	  database name and the database handle. 
	  The :memory: is a special database name using which results in 
	  opening an in-memory database. The function's return code indicates
	  whether the database was successfully opened. The SQLITE_OK is returned
	  when the connection was successfully established.
* sqlite3_errmsg(db);
	* If the return code indicates an error, we print the message to the 
	  console, close the database handle, and terminate the program.
	  The sqlite3_errmsg() function returns a description of the error. Whether 
	  or not an error occurs when it is opened, resources associated with the 
	  database connection handle should be released by passing it to 
	  sqlite3_close() function.
