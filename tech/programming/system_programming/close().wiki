= Close System Call =

* The close system call will close the opened file. Close system call will take single input that is fd value 
  returned by open system call. On successful execution it returns zero and on failure it returns -1. To use this 
  system call use unistd.h. Use different fd values for different files. Dont loose fd values, if lost we cannot 
  perform any type of read, write, close operations on that file
