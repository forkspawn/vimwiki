= Basic Linux =

  When system calls are used in programs, the process exection will switch from user mode to kernel mode and 
  executes the system call and returns to the user mode. 
  
  The users, groups, files and processes are four fundamental objects for understanding the linux programming. When 
  user creates a new file, the file contains common permissions.
  	1. users/owners
	2. groups
	3. others
  
  The linux only allows if the user has an account in the system. The linux maintains the following information for 
  each user in /usr/etc/passwd or /etc/passwd file. For each user account kernel will allocate seperate workspace in
  /home/basith directory. In /etc/ directory has system and user configurations. /etc/passwd has the following 
  information:
  
  username:userid:password:groupid:home directory of user:shell
  
  Every user of linux system is identified by unique identifier(uid). There are lot of ids when dealing with system 
  programming like:
  when dealing with process --> pid(process id)
  when dealing with users --> uid(user id)
  when dealing with groups --> gid(group id)
  when dealing with ipc objects --> unique value 
  
  / --> root directory
  /bin --> contains essential low level utilities(essential system applications)
  /usr/bin --> higher level system utilities and application programs
  /sbin --> super user system utilities(for performing system administration task)
  /lib --> libraries like c libs etc. They are in object format or precompiled format. They could be static(.a) or 
  		   dynamic libraries(.so).
  /usr/lib --> contains program libraries for higher level user.
  /etc --> system and application configuration files
  /proc --> contains each active process information(proc virtual file system)
  /dev --> contains device files
  /usr/include --> conatins header files 
  
  Type of files:
  	- Normal text files(text files)
	- Executable files(audio, programs, videos)
	- Special files
		* Device files 
		* Ipc objects
			* Pipes
			* Named pipes 
			* Message queues
			* Shared memories
		* Sockets
	- Directories(They are also files)
  
  	These files has permissions. ls -l command will display the files, directories, permissions, links, owner, 
	group, type of file, size, timestamps, name of the files. From gui, properties will give the information of 
	each file. 
	
	{{file:/home/basith/Pictures/ls_command.png|Files, their types, permissions etc}}
	{{file:/home/basith/Pictures/files_permissions_type.png|Files, their types, permissions etc}}
	
	file type:
	d --> directory
	l --> link
	c --> character device
	b --> block 
	p --> pipe
	s --> special file(like sockets) 
	
  Permissions:
    - File permissions are represented in octal format. The number before octal represents type of file. To 
	  differentiate between directory and executable file, use filetype. See the picture.
	  {{file:/home/basith/Pictures/files_permissions_type2.png|Files, their types, permissions etc}}
	  {{file:/home/basith/Pictures/files_permissions_type3.png|Files, their types, permissions etc}} 
		
	- Fiel permissions can be changed in two ways: 
	  1. Commands (These commands already exists in OS)
	  2. System Programs (Creating new programs to change permissions)
