You are all right. As a matter of fact, Consuming of flesh and meat is very important, the importance is 
that of shedding blood for the sake of the Almighty God. It is a sacred and most valuable religious act 
(apparantly a formality) to shed blood in compliance for Allah's command. It means O God! I am all ready to 
sacrifice and slaughter my own self in Your obedience. O God! You are my owner, Master and Lord. To Thee I 
submit and and I am fully pleased to sacrifice all my belongings, even my own self, nay even  my whole family 
for the preservation and upliftment of Thy cause and KALIMAH. MA'HA'  HYDERABAD, INDIA

The Day of Arafah (YOU WON'T REGRET READING THIS In Sha Allah)
We've all heard so much about Arafah and its virtues, so much so that it has almost turned out to become mere facts just being related on repeat! 
Ask yourself ⁉️: 
▪️Have I actually internalized and comprehended what Arafah is?
▪️Have I truly understood the MAGNITUDE of this magnificent Day?
▪️Am I going to let it pass like any other ordinary day?

Well, let me tell you in short why your heart should be racing so fast just at the thought of being blessed with the opportunity of witnessing this tremendous Day!

1️⃣  It is the BEST day the sun has ever risen or will rise upon!
2️⃣  It is the Day on which Allah perfected His religion, completed His favors upon us and approved for us Islam as a way of life!
3️⃣  It is the Day Allah frees the most number of His slaves from the Hell-Fire.
4️⃣  It is the ONLY day Allah, The Most High descends to the lowest heaven in the day time (a descension in a way 
	that befits Him, Glory be to Him)
5️⃣  It is the Day Allah praises (shows off), His righteous slaves to the angels!

Ya Subhanallah! By Allah only a wretched person will let this Day go past him in a state of heedlessness!

⭕What is the best thing I can do on this day? 

DU'AA, DU'AA and DU'AA!

Yes, that's it! The Prophet ﷺ said: "The best dua'a is the du'aa on the Day of Arafah" 

 ⭕When does this special time begin?

          عشية عرفة

Majority of the scholars say that it is from Dhuhr to Maghrib or just a little before Asr to Maghrib.

This whole time for du'aa? YES!
Do you feel a little overwhelmed? How do I start my du'aa? How do I organize it? How do I get it all right?

⭕Here are 7 EASY points to categorize your Du'aa into:

1️⃣  Start by praising, and glorifying Allah. Reach onto Him through His beautiful names. Don't rush. Praise Him till your heart feels content, for He is indeed worthy of ALL praise. Look up du'aas from the Qur'aan and authentic Sunnah on this regard.

2️⃣  Send Salutations upon Rasoolullah ﷺ. Again, don't rush. Take your time. Internalize what it means to send salutations upon him. Bear witness that Rasoolullah fulfilled his responsibility and passed  the message (of Islam) the way it had to be. 

3️⃣  Thank Allah and show Him gratitude for ALL his blessings  upon you, and seek refuge in Him from the removal of His blessings
Ta ke your time! Try going through each and every blessing that comes to your mind and thank Allah for it. Blessing of Islam. Blessing of health. Blessing of parents. Blessing of safety. Etc etc. Be specific! Be personal!

4️⃣  Istighfar, Repentance. Humble yourself in front of Allah. Own up to Him for all your sins. Beg Him to forgive you. Cry your heart out! Again take your time. Do  not rush!

5️⃣  YOUR personal time, ask Allah for ALL you want in THIS LIFE pertaining your deen and dunya. Wealth, health, marriage, guidance, righteousness, success. Anything and everything pour it out with a heart full of conviction that Allah is listening and He knows and will answer!

6️⃣  Al Barzakh, The AFTER LIFE. Here you make du'aas pertaining moments before death, after death, the grave, the Day of Judgement, the Siraat, Jannah, protection from Hell-Fire Etc. Ask Allah to grant you a good ending. Ask Allah for firmness at the time of questioning. Etc. 

7️⃣  End by sending salutations upon Rasoolullah ﷺ. Ask Allah to grant you His intercession on the Day of Judgement. Ask Allah to grant you a drink from his Houdh.

🛑Take your time through each category. Pause. Relflect. Humble yourself, breakdown in front of Allah. Show Him your weakness and surrender to Him with utmost humility. 

🛑The Prophet ﷺ said:
"خير الدعاء دعاء يوم عرفة، وخير ما قلت أنا والنبيون من قبلي لا إله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له، له الملك وله الحمد وهو على كل شيء قدير"

"The best supplication is on the Day of Arafat and the best supplication said by me and the prophets before me: There is no God but Allah alone, He has no partner. To Allah is the dominion, and to Him is the praise and He is Capable of all things"
