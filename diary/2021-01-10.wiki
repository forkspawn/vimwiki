Didnt do any of the task because it's 10 PM and was busy in not useful stuff.
When I was practicing at 6:30 father called me to do the iphone account deletion.
It took a lot of time to see the info abount how to delete the account and I 
lost my interest in programming.

These are some fucking reasons. I'm unable to do. Why I'm not doing now, bcoz
I watch manga or some youtube video, Not at all in the mood to do. I need to 
wake up at 6 AM so I cant do now. FuckFuckFuck. 

I'm using too many bad words. I'm saying those to myself. I cant control my 
life. My father and mother controls it. Feeling too much guilt. Fuuuuuuuuck.
