TODO 
- [✓] Do some of yesterdays task.
	- [✓] vid 25, 26 is finished(udemy ldd1)
- [✓] Learn little bit of gdb


= Notes =
Watched gdb video instead of doing recursive function problems because I want 
to know how the code is being executed or whether the code is doing as I want 
it to behave. Learned a little bit of GDB but I'm not very comfortable in it.
Need more practice.

Video 27 needs linux kernel of raspberrypi because hello_world.c needs to run
on raspberrypi4. Its 1 AM and I dont have time to do it.
