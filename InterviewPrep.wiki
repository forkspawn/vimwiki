		4. Kernel Programming

		I was looking for a job which suite my skills. After completing my engineering I started looking for jobs. 
		(I had backlogs and to clear those backlogs it has taken quite a while.)
		This is the brief introduction about me.
		
	Why did you took so long to complete your backlogs.
		My father was laid off of his job. He didn't want to continue doing the job abroad so he came back to india). He 
		started business here and the business was very hecktic in the beginning. So most of the time I was resposible 
		for handling the business.
